Welcome to the 2022 edition of the GEODES Research Day and Symposium. This event aims to bring together current members of GEODES to exchange research results, ideas, and plans.<br/><br/>

<h3>Motivation and goals</h3>

The Research Day serves multiple purposes.<br/>
The event provides <b>graduate students</b> with an excellent opportunity to hone their presentation skills and to get ready for larger venues (workshops, conferences). This is especially important as life gets back to normal after COVID-19, and scientific events will switch to in-person formats (at least partially).<br/>
The series of presentations allows for a hands-on assessment of the balance between the <a href="/about">focus areas</a> of the group. <b>Professors and postdocs</b> might want to leverage this opportunity for roadmapping exercises and setting tangible goals for the forthcoming year.<br/>
Finally, this event provides <b>permanent members and visiting scholars</b> a structured way of learning about each other's focus areas, research directions and latest results, thereby fostering future collaborations.
<br/><br/>

<h3>Coordinates</h3>
Date: <b>May 17, 2022</b> at <b>08:45</b>. <br/>
Location: <b>Campus MIL, Room A-3561</b>. 1375 Ave.Thérèse-Lavoie-Roux, Montréal<br/><br/>

This is an <b>in-person event</b>. 
<br/><br/>

<h3>Format</h3>
The event consists of two distinct parts: the Research Day, and the Symposium.<br/>
First, during the Research Day, we will entertain a range of presentations and demos. We kick off at 08:45AM, and conclude around 5PM.<br/>
Then, around 6PM, we proceed with the Symposium, an informal get-together.<br/><br/>

--->
<!---
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>research and/or development results;</li>
    <li>reflections and lessons learned;</li>
    <li>future plans, roadmaps;</li>
    <li>novel topics, overviews, aggregated knowledge outside of the (current) scope of the group that have the potential to improve and contribute to the body-of-knowledge of the group.</li>
</ul>

<b>Professors</b> are invited to give a keynote talk of 15-20 minutes at the beginning of the thematic tracks. This is an excellent opportunity to introduce the remainder of the track as a big picture, by connecting topics and people within a larger scope.<br/>
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>reflections on the previous year(s);</li>
    <li>future plans, roadmaps;</li>
    <li>specific research topics.</li>
</ul>

<b>Visiting scholars</b> are invited to give a talk on their research. We will try to allocate as much time for these talks as possible, and will consider a dedicated block for visitors.<br/><br/>

<h3>Publication</h3>

After the event, we will publish the materials on the GEODES website, such as a book of abstracts and a combined material with every presentation. Therefore, we encourage everyone to prepare conference-quality content. Digital supplementary materials, such as videos and replication packages are welcome. Although these materials will not be presented during the Research Day, they will be published on the website.<br/><br/>
