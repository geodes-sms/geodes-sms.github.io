        A high-quality research agenda would not be possible without (inter)national grants. We also believe a balanced
        research portfolio can only be sustainable by maintaining strong connections with our industrial partners.
        In our R&D projects, we strive to contribute innovative techniques, methods, and tools to the state of the art
        and
        the state of the practice.
