                <p><em>Abstract</em>&nbsp;As a contribution to the adoption of the Model Driven Engineering
                    (MDE) paradigm, the research community has proposed solutions to concrete
                    model-transformation (MT) problems for the MDE infrastructure or for domainspecific
                    problems. However, as the adoption increases and with the advent of the
                    new initiatives for the creation of repositories, it is legitimate to question whether
                    proposals for specific transformation problems can be still considered as research
                    contributions or if they respond to a practical/technical work. In this paper, we
                    report on a systematic mapping study that aims at understanding the trends and
                    characteristics of specific model transformations published during the past 15
                    years. Our study shows that the number of papers with, as main contribution,
                    a specific transformation solution, is not as high as expected. This number increased
                    to reach a pick in 2010 and is decreasing since then. Our results also
                    include a characterization and an analysis of the published proposals following a
                    rigorous classification scheme.</p>
                <p><em>Results</em>&nbsp;Here are available the 82 papers we took in consideration for the mapping, and their classification into the scheme we detailed. </p>
