By decoupling the control system and high-level decision-making from physical operations, DTs offer adaptive, cost-effective and easy-to-evolve solutions. In particular DTs integrate deductive engineering models with inductive data-driven analytics, to fuel powerful simulations, predictions, visualizations and adaptive system management capabilities.

For example, there is no consensus on a cross-industry reference architecture model to facilitate digital twin engineering. Thus, despite their promise, current DT implementations often remain fragmented, domain-specific, and expensive to develop and maintain. In this talk, we will present the use cases typology and the generic functional architecture model for DTs, applicable by any industrial company proposed by the French Industry Alliance (AIF).

Bio: Pascale Vicat-Blanc is Senior Research Scientist at Inria (french National Institute for Computer Science), where she is “Chargée de Mission pour l’Industrie du Futur”. PVB received a Habilitation à Diriger les recherches (HDR) in Computer Science from ENS Lyon, a PhD and Engineering degree in Computer Science from INSA Lyon. She is currently launching with Benoit Combemale, a national program for Engineering Digital Twin (EDT) in the context the National Agency for Computer Science and Software Research (Algorithme Logiciel et Usages - ALU) coordinated by Inria. Expert in Internet protocols, Network virtualization and programming (NFV, SDN), Internet of Things (IoT), her current research interests cover Digital Infrastructure Observability and Digital Twin technology. She has been supervising 15 PhD students, co-authoring 180+ international journals and conferences articles, 2 books and 12 granted FR and US patents. She participated to the development of software (SaaS) products commercialized by the three startups she created and managed in France and the USA. PVB has been Lecturer in Computer Science in various engineering schools in Lyon. She has also been Senior Director Product Development at F5 Networks (USA) where she was head of IoT &amp; Network Analytics product innovation. PVB is member of the Scientific Council of the French Computer Society, of the Scientific Council of the IRT SystemX and at the board of the Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon.
