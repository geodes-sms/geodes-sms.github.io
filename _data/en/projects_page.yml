  A high-quality research agenda would not be possible without (inter)national grants. We also believe a balanced research portfolio can only be 
  sustainable by maintaining strong connections with our industrial partners.<br>
  In our R&D projects, we strive to contribute innovative techniques, methods, and tools to the state of the art and the state of the practice.
