history: >
  GEODES was founded as part of DIRO in 1992. It was then called GÉLO and changed to GEODES in 2005. 
  Since then, more than 30 students have obtained a PhD degree from the group, and over 100 students
  have graduated with a Master's degree. Many of these students are professors in Quebec, Canada, and
  around the world (ÉTS, Laval, Polytechnique, UQAM, Ottawa, DePaul, Houston, Indiana, Michigan, United Arab Emirates, etc.),
  and others hold key positions at large tech companies.
  <br />
  GEODES is a very active research group with over 20 publications per year in journals, conference proceedings, 
  and book chapters. The group has developed strong connections with local SMEs and large industrial groups, 
  leading to frequent collaborations and projects.

  We are active members of our extended scientific community. Recently, we have organized the 23rd and
  25th editions of the
