  title: "Improving online visibility for you and your research"
  short_description:
    Academic visibility is important for disseminating information about you and your research, which can lead to further citations and professional opportunities. This talk discusses basic 'channels' for such dissemination online, such as ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and personal websites. Examples and suggestions for how to maintain these channels are presented.
  description:
    Visibility is a key success factor for researchers to increase their impact in academica. A particular challenge of academic visibility is that it requires effort over time.
    This talk will provide the audience with motivation and specific recommendations for increasing their academic visibility online.
    Specifically, online 'channels' such as ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and personal websites are discussed, along with best practices and tips for maintaining up-to-date information.
    This talk is for early-stage and mid-stage researchers who are interested in improving their online presence.

  title: Multi-paradigm modeling of complex heterogeneous systems – Are we there yet?
  short_description: 
    To cope with the increasing complexity of nowadays systems, their engineering is best approached through modeling.
    Multi-paradigm modeling (MPM) advocates modeling aspects of the system using the most appropriate formalisms.
    The diverse nature of these formalisms allows for increased descriptive power but complicates coordination between stakeholders.
    This, in turn, gives rise to inconsistencies which might result in faulty or suboptimal products.
    This talk introduces the results of three research lines, addressing major challenges in MPM on (i) inconsistency management, (ii) real-time collaboration, and (iii) modeling automation by machine learning.
  description:
    Nowadays engineered systems have reached a previously unprecedented complexity. Systems are becoming faster, more autonomous, and more safety-critical. To cope with this increasing complexity, engineering is best approached through modeling.
    Throughout the design, engineering, and assembly stages of a system, modeling offers many benefits. For example, the design-space of the system can be explored easily by multiple stakeholders, or properties can be formally verified at the early stages of system construction. Model-driven engineering also enables the partial synthesis of the system, eliminating many sources of human error from the overall process.
    Multi-paradigm modeling (MPM), specifically, advocates modeling aspects of the system using the most appropriate formalisms. The diverse nature of these formalisms allows for increased descriptive power but complicates coordination between stakeholders. Pertinent examples are cyber-physical and mechatronic systems which feature various mechanical, electrical, and software components. In such settings, a common vocabulary among stakeholders cannot be assumed. This, in turn, gives rise to inconsistencies between stakeholder models, which might result in faulty or suboptimal products.
    This talk introduces three lines of research addressing major challenges in MPM. First, the PROxIMA inconsistency management framework focuses on optimizing and intelligently orchestrating the overall system engineering process. Second, the Lowkey framework allows for real-time collaborative modeling between heterogeneous stakeholders. Third, a technique for the automated inference of simulation models by reinforcement learning to further automate system engineering tasks.

  title: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
  short_description:
    Reinforcement learning is a mathematical framework to infer and represent knowledge. Reinforcement learning has shown promising results in the recent years in the quest for building a general learning agent that act as human do. This seminar provides a gentle introduction to the topic of reinforcement learning, introduces some of the recent advancements, and outlines future challenges.

  title: Moose – A modular, composable software analysis environment
  short_description:
    Advanced reverse engineering tools are required to cope with the complexity of software systems and the specific requirements of different tasks (re-architecturing, migration, evolution). Consequently, reverse engineering tools should adapt to a wide range of situations. Yet, because they require a large infrastructure investment, being able to reuse these tools is key. Moose is a reverse engineering environment answering these requirements. While Moose started as a research project 20 years ago, it is also used in industrial projects, exposing itself to all these difficulties. In this talk we present the new version of Moose. It revolves around a composable meta-model; interacting micro-tools; and an open architecture supporting the synchronization and interaction of tools per task.

  title: The ongoing problem of reuse and evolution in software architectures: illustration through four research projects
  short_description:
    These last years, my research work has been mainly oriented towards the needs of companies and industries, looking for social and economic impacts.
    I will briefly introduce 4 different research issues and adopted approaches to address them&#58; 1) Microservice migration,
    2) Asynchronous business-event choreography, 3) Business-IT Alignment and 4) Eco-design in shipbuilding.
    The objective of my presentation is not to detail each work but to give you an overview of my current research interests, and, ultimately, to open the discussion with you about a question that has been bothering me for a long time&#58; is it possible to move from craft to industrialization in Software engineering?

  title: Fine-grained Analysis of Similar Code Snippets
  short_description:
    Code recommendation relies on code snippets extracted from projects to provide suggestions.
    Thus, extracting and characterizing reusable and recurring code structures is essential.
    In this work, we characterize recurring code structures through parametrizable code templates.
    Code templates can outline the common structure in code snippets along with their variation points, hence providing a convenient way to define their structural similarity.
    We propose an approach leveraging the Pattern Structure framework to highlight and organize groups of similar snippets.

    Code recommendation approaches such as code search or code repair may rely on code snippets or code templates extracted from existing projects to provide these suggestions.
    In this context, extracting and characterizing reusable and recurring code structures beforehand is thus essential.
    In this work, we characterize recurring code structures through parametrizable code templates.
    Code templates can outline the common structure in code snippets along with their variation points, hence providing a convenient way to define their structural similarity. Pattern Structure is a mathematical data analysis framework for organizing objects depending on their similarity&#58; it produces a structure supporting clustering, analysis, and knowledge discovery tasks.
    We propose an approach leveraging this framework and similarity defined through code templates to highlight and organize groups of similar snippets.
