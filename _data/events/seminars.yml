  short_description: Join us for a presentation on IDEA, an adaptive software architecture that enhances cooperation between humans and AI systems using the social identity approach. By understanding group dynamics and leveraging game-theoretic models, IDEA improves the resilience of communities and emergency services during urban mass emergencies. Discover how this innovative system fosters reliable and trustworthy human-AI collaboration.
  description: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems often require interaction and cooperation with humans to achieve their goals.  However, human behaviour is uncertain and complex, and so it can be difficult to reason about it formally. Specifying, designing, implementing, and deploying AI systems able to cooperate with humans is challenging but crucial for reliability and trustworthiness of those AI systems.  In this talk, I will present IDEA: an adaptive software architecture that enables cooperation between humans and autonomous systems, by leveraging in the social identity approach. This approach establishes that group membership drives human behaviour. Identity and group membership are crucial during emergencies, as they influence cooperation among survivors. IDEA systems infer the social identity of surrounding humans, thereby establishing their group membership. By reasoning about groups, we limit the number of cooperation strategies the system needs to explore. IDEA systems select a strategy from the equilibrium analysis of game-theoretic models, that represent interactions between group members and the IDEA system. I will show how this approach can extend AI systems’ capability to enhance the resilience of local communities and emergency services in the aftermath of a mass emergency in an urban area by facilitating their effective cooperation."

  title: Extending Scala for Safe Concurrent Programming
  short_description: Concurrent programming is notorious for hazards such as data races and deadlocks. At the same time, program executions are difficult to reproduce due to various sources of nondeterminism, complicating the debugging of concurrent programs. These challenges have motivated work on ensuring safety statically using type systems. Type-based prevention of data races is a major challenge in the context of object-oriented programming languages due to pervasive mutation and aliasing. In addition, extending the type systems of existing languages is a challenge, preventing recent advances from practical use.

    Recommender systems for software engineering (RSSEs) are complex software systems that suggest relevant items of interest according to the application domain, e.g., code snippets, Q&A posts, and third-party libraries. 
    The development of RSs encompasses the execution of different steps, including data preprocessing, choice of appropriate algorithms, and item delivery, to name a few. 
    Though RSs can alleviate the curse of information overload, existing approaches resemble black-box systems, where the end-user is not supposed to customize the overall process.

  title: A Multi-Step Learning Approach to Assist Code Review
  short_description: 
    Modern code review is a process for early detection and reduction of issues. However, this is a highly manual activity that requires a lot of resources and time.
    In this work, we aim to assist the reviewer in the code review process. We propose an approach for detecting the type of issue and locating parts of the code that need to be revised by developers.  
  description: >
    Modern code review is a process for early detection and reduction of issues, which assists in ensuring the quality of the source code, detecting anomalies, and identifying potential improvements. 
    However, this is a highly manual activity that requires a lot of resources and time.  
    Recent research has addressed these problems by attempting to entirely automate this task (i.e., generating code reviews). 
    However, we do believe that dismissing the reviewer from this process is not the best option in terms of its optimal functioning, especially considering the high error rates in the proposed approaches. 
    Furthermore, this full automation is still too far to achieve given the complexity of the task that requires human intelligence. 
    In this work, we aim to assist the reviewer in the code review process. 
    We propose an approach for detecting the type of issue and locating parts of the code that need to be revised by developers.  
    In the first phase, we propose a meta-learner that combines a learning-based model and a knowledge-based model to predict the type of issue from the review comment.  
    Then, we use this component to create and label a large dataset composed of quadruplets <original code, review, issue type, revised code>. 
    We use this data set to fine-tune a pre-trained language model to predict the types of issues (e.g., naming, resource handling, etc.), that need to be addressed in the original code snippet.  
    Furthermore, we fine-tune another pre-trained language model to locate these issues in the source code submitted by developers. 
    We evaluate the performance of our approach using a test set not considered during the training. 
    Our results show that our model accurately locates and predicts the types of issues.

  title: Migrating Enterprise applications into Software Product Lines
  short_description: Software Product Lines represent one of the most exciting paradigms shift in software development in the last two decades. The main objective is to improve reuse by focusing not only on the development of a single software product but on a family of related product variants. Over the years, multiple research approaches have been proposed to address the different activities of variability design and manipulation, reusable assets implementation, or product derivation. However, implementing SPL variability is still a major challenge and represents a risk for a company. Indeed, compared to single-system development, SPL variability management implies a methodology that highly impacts the life cycle of the products as well as the processes and roles inside the company. To break these barriers to SPL adoption in the industry, we propose  a new software platform that assists developers in migrating existing applications into SPL. This tool is built with a language-independent engine to support any programming language. In this talk, we present the research foundations related to the implementation of tour platform.  The talk will be guided with live demos on real applications.

  title: Uncertainty in Software Models
  short_description: When designing and operating with software and systems, stakeholders and modelers often face situations in which they need to deal with uncertain data and information. These uncertainties may originate from different reasons such as vagueness, imprecision, incompleteness or inconsistencies. In many cases, neglecting these uncertainties may have disastrous consequences. In this talk, we will explain the different types of uncertainty that can appear when dealing with software models, paying particular attention to measurement uncertainty and belief uncertainty. We will explain an approach to capture, operate and propagate these uncertainties as well as a strategy and methodology to make informed decisions when different stakeholders are involved.

  title: "Learning from Code Repositories to Recommend Model Classes"
  short_description: "With the growing popularity of machine learning algorithms, dramatic advances have been made for code completion, and specifically method-call completion. These advances were also possible thanks to the availability of large code repositories to learn from and to the well-defined boundaries of the method-call completion problem. This is, however, not the case for design completion, where model repositories are scarce and the space of possibilities for design completion is theoretically infinite. We propose in this presentation an approach that learns numeric representations of domain concepts and their relations from code repositories in order to recommend classes for UML class diagrams."

  short_description:
    Code recommendation relies on code snippets extracted from projects to provide suggestions.
    Thus, extracting and characterizing reusable and recurring code structures is essential.
    In this work, we characterize recurring code structures through parametrizable code templates.
    Code templates can outline the common structure in code snippets along with their variation points, hence providing a convenient way to define their structural similarity.
    We propose an approach leveraging the Pattern Structure framework to highlight and organize groups of similar snippets.

  title: Moose – A modular, composable software analysis environment
  short_description:
    Advanced reverse engineering tools are required to cope with the complexity of software systems and the specific requirements of different tasks (re-architecturing, migration, evolution). Consequently, reverse engineering tools should adapt to a wide range of situations. Yet, because they require a large infrastructure investment, being able to reuse these tools is key. Moose is a reverse engineering environment answering these requirements. While Moose started as a research project 20 years ago, it is also used in industrial projects, exposing itself to all these difficulties. In this talk we present the new version of Moose. It revolves around a composable meta-model; interacting micro-tools; and an open architecture supporting the synchronization and interaction of tools per task.

  title: Multi-paradigm modeling of complex heterogeneous systems – Are we there yet?
  short_description: 
    To cope with the increasing complexity of nowadays systems, their engineering is best approached through modeling.
    Multi-paradigm modeling (MPM) advocates modeling aspects of the system using the most appropriate formalisms.
    The diverse nature of these formalisms allows for increased descriptive power but complicates coordination between stakeholders.
    This, in turn, gives rise to inconsistencies which might result in faulty or suboptimal products.
    This talk introduces the results of three research lines, addressing major challenges in MPM on (i) inconsistency management, (ii) real-time collaboration, and (iii) modeling automation by machine learning.
  description:
    Nowadays engineered systems have reached a previously unprecedented complexity. Systems are becoming faster, more autonomous, and more safety-critical. To cope with this increasing complexity, engineering is best approached through modeling.
    Throughout the design, engineering, and assembly stages of a system, modeling offers many benefits. For example, the design-space of the system can be explored easily by multiple stakeholders, or properties can be formally verified at the early stages of system construction. Model-driven engineering also enables the partial synthesis of the system, eliminating many sources of human error from the overall process.
    Multi-paradigm modeling (MPM), specifically, advocates modeling aspects of the system using the most appropriate formalisms. The diverse nature of these formalisms allows for increased descriptive power but complicates coordination between stakeholders. Pertinent examples are cyber-physical and mechatronic systems which feature various mechanical, electrical, and software components. In such settings, a common vocabulary among stakeholders cannot be assumed. This, in turn, gives rise to inconsistencies between stakeholder models, which might result in faulty or suboptimal products.
    This talk introduces three lines of research addressing major challenges in MPM. First, the PROxIMA inconsistency management framework focuses on optimizing and intelligently orchestrating the overall system engineering process. Second, the Lowkey framework allows for real-time collaborative modeling between heterogeneous stakeholders. Third, a technique for the automated inference of simulation models by reinforcement learning to further automate system engineering tasks.
