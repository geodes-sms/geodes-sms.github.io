GEODES got four papers accepted for the co-located and satellite events of the [ACM/IEEE 24th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2021). The four papers are:
 - _Metamodel Refactoring using Constraint Solving: A Quality-based Perspective_, by [Oussama Ben Sghaier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oussama-ben-sghaier/), [Houari Sahraoui](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~sahraouh/) and [Michalis Famelis](https://michalis.famelis.info/), @the [13th System Analysis and Modelling Conference (SAM2021)](https://sdl-forum.org/Events/SAM2021).
 - _Towards Checking Consistency-Breaking Updates between Models and Generated Artifacts_, by [MohammadAmin Zaheri](http://zaheri.info/), [Eugene Syriani](http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~syriani/) and [Michalis Famelis](https://michalis.famelis.info/), @the [14th Workshop on Models and Evolution (ME 2021)](http://www.models-and-evolution.com/2021/).
 - _Inference of Simulation Models in Digital Twins by Reinforcement Learning_, by [Istvan David](https://istvandavid.com/), [Jessie Galasso](https://jgalasso.github.io/) and [Eugene Syriani](http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~syriani/) @the [1st International Workshop on Model-Driven Engineering of Digital Twins (ModDiT 2021)](https://gemoc.org/events/moddit2021).
 - _Modeling the Engineering Process of an Agent-based Production System: An Exemplar Study_, Burak Karaduman (University of Antwerp, Belgium), [Istvan David](https://istvandavid.com/) and Moharram Challenger (University of Antwerp, Belgium) @the [3rd International Workshop on Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems (MPM4CPS’21)](http://msdl.cs.mcgill.ca/conferences/MPM4CPS/2021/).
 
The [workshops of MODELS](https://conf.researchr.org/track/models-2021/models-2021-workshops) serve a crucial role in the early validation of preliminary scientific work and new visions within the modeling community.
