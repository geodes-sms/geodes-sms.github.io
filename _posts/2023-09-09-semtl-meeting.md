Our group organized a [SEMTL meeting](https://semtl.github.io/) at [Station Biologiques des Laurentides](https://sbl.umontreal.ca/accueil/) to enable researchers in software engineering from various groups to share their work. This gathering allowed us to foster ideas about future research and start new collaborations.

The SEMTL meeting was part of a two-day research retreat (Sep. 8, 2023 &ndash; Sep 9, 2023). 

## Research retreat

### Day one: SEMTL meeting

Day one was dedicated to the SEMTL meeting, beginning with a keynote, then short presentations, and closing with a social event. 
The aim was to encourage contact between institutions in Montreal and ensure that researchers have another venue to share their work and start collaborations. 


### Day two: GEODES at work (and having fun)
