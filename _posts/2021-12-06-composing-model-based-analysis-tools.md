The results of the 19481 Dagstuhl Seminar on "Composing Model-Based Analysis Tools" are now available as a [book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-81915-6).

The book contains two chapters co-authored by GEODES professors:
[Exploiting Results of Model-Based Analysis Tools](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-81915-6_7) by [Houari Sahraoui](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~sahraouh/), and
[Living with Uncertainty in Model-Based Development](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-81915-6_8) by [Michalis Famelis](https://michalis.famelis.info/).

The book offers foundations, challenges and concepts for composition and analysis in model-driven engineering, with case studies and tool examples.
