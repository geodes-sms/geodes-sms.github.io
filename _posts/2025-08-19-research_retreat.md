The **Station Biologique des Laurentides (SBL)** is a field station of the Université de Montréal located in Saint-Hippolyte, about 90 km north of Montréal. Surrounded by forests and lakes, it offers a peaceful and stimulating environment for scientific discussions, seminars, and collaborative work.  

The **GEODES Research Group** will hold its **Annual Research Retreat** there from September 5 to 7. This event is an opportunity to reflect on past achievements, plan research directions for the coming year, and strengthen collaborations within the group.

Each member of the group will present and discuss their research plans for the coming year. These sessions are designed to foster constructive feedback, identify synergies within the group, and align research goals with ongoing projects.  

We are pleased to welcome **[Luciano Marchezan](https://lucianomarchezan.github.io/)**, a newly arrived postdoctoral researcher in the group, as our keynote speaker. He will present his research at the [Institute of Software Systems Engineering (ISSE)](https://isse.jku.at/) in Linz, Austria.  

## Writing Session
