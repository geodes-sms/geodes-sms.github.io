The paper [A generic approach to detect design patterns in model transformations using a string-matching algorithm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10270-021-00936-4) by Chihab Mokaddem, [Houari Sahraoui](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~sahraouh/) and [Eugene Syriani](http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~syriani/) has been published in the Software and Systems Modeling (SoSyM) journal.

The paper proposes a generic approach to detect, semi-automatically, design patterns and their variations in model transformations. The approach is able to detect complete and partial implementations of design patterns in transformations, which is useful to refactoring and improving model transformations.
