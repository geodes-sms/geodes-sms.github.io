The proposal for the [1st Hands-on Workshop on Collaborative Modeling](http://howcom2021.github.io/) by Istvan David and Eugene Syriani has been accepted for this year's [MODELS conference](http://www.modelsconference.org/). The organizing committee includes [Antonio Garcia-Dominguez](https://www.cs.aston.ac.uk/~garcia-a/), known for his work on the evaluation of modeling tools ([TTC](https://www.transformation-tool-contest.eu/cfs.html)).

The workshop is another one in the research group's long list of contributions to the modeling community. Last year's MODELS, apart from being organized by Eugene Syriani and Houari Sahraoui, also featured the [1st Uncertainty in Modeling Workshop](https://richpaige.github.io/uncertainty2020/) by Michalis Famelis (with Fiona Polack and Richard Paige).
