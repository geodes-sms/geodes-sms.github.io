[Louis-Edouard Lafontant](http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~lafontle/) presented his invited talk [_Creating a language with Gentleman: a lightweight web-based projectional editor_](https://strumenta.community/meetup/virtual-meetup-louis-edouard-lafontant/) at the [Strumenta Community's regular meetup](https://strumenta.community/meetup/). 

[Gentleman](https://github.com/geodes-sms/gentleman) is a lightweight web-based projectional editor for creating and manipulating domain specific languages (DSLs) in a unique, concept-oriented way. Gentleman offers an alternative to currently used solutions that are typically heavyweight, platform-specific, and suffer from poor usability. More details on the framework are available in the MODELS 2020 [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3417990.3421998) co-authored by [Louis-Edouard Lafontant](http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~lafontle/) and [Eugene Syriani](http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~syriani/).
