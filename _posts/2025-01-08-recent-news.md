This fall, GEODES hosted the latest SEMTL at the University of Montreal. The event started with a keynote by new assistant professor [Damien Masson] on *Designing Interfaces That Adapt to Their Users*. It featured presentations from GEODES Ph.D. students and ended with a panel on Software Visualization, discussing software quality, modeling languages, and AI models.
